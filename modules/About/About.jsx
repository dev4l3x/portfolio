          I started software development when I was a little boy. I am a very
          curious person and always trying to learn about the things that I feel
          unknown. That is the reason why I started coding when I was a boy, to
          understand how computer apps were made. I started with javascript,
          making static pages (after some hello worldâ€˜s) without much
          complexity. I remember that great feeling of just writing some code
          and see how the computer just did whatever you told him to do.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout high school, I wondered how desktop applications and
          dynamic pages were supported. This led me to get a brief introduction
          to the awesome world of object oriented programming. I started
          learning some Java while trying to do some new projects. This passion
          made me focus on computer programming, which I already knew was my
          passion. Then, I started my computer science degree where I learned a
          lot of interesting things like algorithms, design patterns, compilers
          and many other things. But the most valuable lesson that I learned at
          university is how much there was yet to learn. <br />
          <br />
          Now I still have this passion and I keep learning day by day, keeping
          in mind that there is always something new to learn or build.
